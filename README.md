# Tic Tac Toe Game

We made a tic tac toc game using python tkinker import.
Our game allow us to play against the AI, or locally against a friend on your computer.
We also started to create a multiplayer version, but we got some problems with our server because he was using the pygame import which was not supported by tkinker.

Nevertheless we got out server running on our VPS, but the client coulnd't connect to it.

In order to play you just have to clone our repository and run "python client.py". 
Doing this you will be able to play our game.
